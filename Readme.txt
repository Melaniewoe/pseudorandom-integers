*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

The program “my_random” implement a class that can generate a sequence of pseudorandom integers. This is a sequence that appears random in many ways. It uses a linear congruence method starts with numbers called seed, the multiplier, the increment, and the modulus. For generating this sequence of pseudorandom number is (multiplier * seed + increment) % modulus.

*  Source files
*******************************************************

Name:  main.cpp
   Main program. This is the file that asks the initial seed number, and prints three sequential numbers generated by the program.

Name:  my_random.h
   Contains the definition for the class pseudorandom.  

Name: my_random.cpp
   Defines and implements the pseudorandom class for implementing a class that generate 
   pseudorandom integers.  
   
*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on Xcode.  It was 
   compiled, run, and tested on gcc ouray.cudenver.edu.

*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip [WoeHW1]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        my_random.h
        my_random.cpp
        makefile
        Readme.txt

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [WoeHW1] 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./[my_random]

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
